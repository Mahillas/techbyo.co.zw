### Getting started

Requirements:

  - Node.js (v14.x)
  - MySQL
  - babel (`npm install -g babel-cli`)
  - knex (`npm install -g knex`)

  1. Clone the repo to your dev machine: `git clone git@github.com:TechBYO/techbyo.co.zw.git`
  2. Run `cd techbyo.co.zw and npm install`
  3. Update `./config/index.js` with your own details
  4. Run migrations: `knex migrate:latest`

**Note:** We would prefer that you fork the repo and only contribute via pull requests.

### Migrations

Migrations are generated using `knex` (`knex migrate:make migration_name`).
When creating a new table it is recommended that you create a schema file inside the `schemas` directory.

### Schema API

  - `tableName` - (String) name of the new table
  - `table`     - (Object) a hash table with table columns their properties

**Schema file example:**

```javascript
module.exports.tableName = 'users';

module.exports.table = {
    id: {type: 'increments', nullable: false, primary: true},
    name: {type: 'string', maxlength: 254, nullable: false},
    email: {type: 'string', maxlength: 254, nullable: false, unique: true, validations: {'isEmail': true}},
    created_at: {type: 'dateTime', nullable: false},
    updated_at: {type: 'dateTime', nullable: true}
};
```
